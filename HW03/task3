a) 8 bytes
b) 0x7fffffffdfb8
c) 0x7fffffffdfb7
d) 10
e) 266
f) It is good to know first that an int is 4 bytes long and a char 2 bytes. The value of arr[0], which is an integer, was 10 which means it is stored as 0000000A (hex) in those 4 bytes. Line 16 casts p to a char and then adds 1 to it which leads to a jump of 2 bytes instead of 4 bytes. Writing c, which is 1, to that address leads to arr[0] to be read as 0000010A in hex, which translates to 266 in decimal.
