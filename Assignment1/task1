To install a package on my operating system, which is CentOS, I have to use the yum package manager.
First I have to get root access by requesting superuser and then authenticating with the root password. After assuming root permissions, I can run yum install [package name] to install any package I like. This time, I will install the GNU Compiler Collection aka gcc. 

Linux package managers will also resolve dependencies, which will also be updated or installed if necessary. After confirmation it will completely install it by itself.
